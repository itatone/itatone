			<h3>Democratic Flipped House Seats</h3>

			<p>WWith the election coming to a final close within California, the Democratic party managed to flip three House of Representative seats within the state. Despite the loss of  the three major branches of government in this election, this can be seen as an accomplishment for the party. The Democrats poured a lot of funding into these three district seats to ensure their chance to flip the seats. First, with Adam Gray in District 13, who won by exactly 187 votes and a 50.0% tie according to NBC News Database. The race was extremely close, but the democratic advertisements and funding towards winning this seat ended with a victory. The second seat was in District 27, George Whitesides won this district by about a 4% margin. Finally, in District 45 with another close margin of 653 votes, for Derek Tran. All of these seats had been by Republican house members for at least two years, and the new Democrats won over the incumbent Republicans. In these close elections the Democrats ended up coming on top, due to their heavy campaigning for these candidates. For these democratic candidates, the specific form of campaigning was advertisements. Whether that be a commercial on television, something that pops up on social media, text messages from the candidates or people related to them, or even simply posters around the district. The way a candidate uses advertisements in their favor is what fuels their campaign, and allows them to win by these slim margins. According to Scott Mann who does many political advertisements for propositions or candidates, to the parties it is not about one specific seat being flipped and it is always about the power, gains and control of branches of government. “It’s not uncommon for a political party or other interests to pour millions of dollars into a campaign.  For statewide and congressional offices it’s often about a political party maintaining or gaining control, or just acquiring the number of seats needed to influence decisions.  That’s one reason selected races for seats that may be vulnerable become such a high priority to fund.  At the end of the day, those with the most money backing them are more likely to prevail.” says Scott Mann. </p>
			<p> Prior to the election in November, the Democrats were already in the minority for the House of Representatives. Being able to take control of the house as well as the senate was a big concern of theirs heading into the 2024 election. Which is why so much funding went into these seats. The party saw an opportunity to flip these seats due to them being vulnerable because they were missing a factor of a strong Republican seat and influential candidate. The common idea within this election was that every seat mattered. They had to keep every seat they had in their control as well as gain as many as possible. Being able to gain three seats in California is also a major accomplishment because as it was, the Republicans only had a handful of seats since California is a predominantly a Democratic state. </p>

			<h4>Political Campagin Spending</h4>

			<p>As of June 30th 2024, in these three districts there was no lack of spending on the end of both parties.. In District 13 there was $1,954,386 spent, District 27 had $4,221,773 and finally District 45 with $3,618,756. Within California it is a law that each candidate discloses how much money they spent on campaigning and advertisements. According to Shirley N. Webe’s Secretary of States page about Campaign & Lobbying. “The Political Reform Act was adopted as a statewide initiative (Proposition 9) by an overwhelming vote of the electorate in 1974. The law requires detailed disclosure of the role of money in California politics. This includes the disclosure of contributions and expenditures in connection with campaigns supporting or opposing state and local candidates and ballot measures as well as the disclosure of expenditures made in connection with lobbying the State Legislature and attempting to influence administrative decisions of state government.”. This gives voters the full information on spending rather than keeping it hidden from the general public, since this may influence their voting decisions. The spending that was made on these house districts shows the competitive nature of the two major political parties. The high spendings shows just how much each party wants this seat in this political chess game. Each party pours in tons of money to guarantee their win for senate and house seats as well as President itself, even though nothing is truly guaranteed within a political and voting system. Having the backing of the party you are running for is the main reason these candidates got all their enormous amounts of funding. If the Democratic party did not support their candidate that was running, and they had to raise all money on their own they would have a more difficult time being able to win the seat. As Scott Mann was saying, the party will identify a seat that is no longer secure and has become vulnerable, and they will pour their money into the candidate matching their beliefs and hope for a chance to take that seat from the other party. There is a lot of observation that goes into choosing a seat that a party will attempt to flip. The opposing party must identify the weakness within that seat, and use it for their own political gain. This makes it simpler to flip a seat, since there is already an internal issue with that seat and the opposing party.

			<p>The overall political system is a chess game that the two major parties love to play. They wait for the right time to make their moves, whether that being a specific advertisement or announcing a candidate to run. The system itself is built off of millions of dollars of funding to different seats and propositions they support. Within California, there is nothing different about this. Each party wants control of government and every house seat helps them build more towards their goals of having majority rule.
